### 1_ymxc.py
`python 1_ymxc.py`
#### Network
The network is just a single neuron which learns a function of the form y=mx+c<br>
Neuron uses a Gradient Descent Optimizer, Squared Difference as cost function and linear activation<br>
#### Data
Data is generated as (x, y) pairs according to an equation, these data points are used to train the network<br>
